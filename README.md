## ⚔️ What is The Holy Grail?

**The Holy Grail** is a modular, cinematic-grade **GIGA workflow** for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), built for creators who demand **total control** over the look, feel, pose, style, and soul of every image.

This isn't just a prompt tool — it's a **vessel for pure imagination**, a system where **face reference, pose reference, emotion, atmosphere**, and **storytelling** merge into one creative stream.

If you've ever wished to take the exact image in your head and bring it into existence — this is how.

## 📦 What's Included?

* `The_Holy_Grail.json` full GIGA workflow
* Ready-to-use LoRA stack and modular blocks
* Face reference (IPAdapter) + Pose reference (ControlNet)
* Conditioning, dual KSampler, detailer, and upscale
* `install.txt` guide for 1-click setup with Git

## ✨ Why It's Different

This is more than a workflow — it’s your personal animation-grade scene generator.
Where others build prompts... **you direct a story**.
Every element you imagine — pose, facial structure, lighting angle, mood — can be defined, referenced, or bypassed.

> **Don’t just prompt AI art. Command it.**
